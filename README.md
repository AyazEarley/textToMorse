# textToMorse
Description:

This is a plugin for Musescore 4, it's purpose is to translate user inputted text into morse code and places it into the score. 
This code was created by reverse engineering other plugins. It is my first ever attempt at creating a plugin.
If there are strong conventions for making plugins, I don't know them yet. I tried my hardest 
to document everything so it's as clear as possible. Email me if you have questions:

How to install: 

Move the folder into the the MuseScore 4 Program files. You should be able to find it at:
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 4\plugins

Open MuseScore, navigate to the top of your screen and click plugins > plugin manager. 
Find the plugin morseToText, click on it and click enable.

How to use:
Highlight a section of the score. Be careful to leave room with rests, it will write over existing notes.
Click plugins > textToMorse
The UI will appear and you can type in your text. Select a pitch, and a unit of smallest rhythm. Click
translate and the morseCode will appear.
